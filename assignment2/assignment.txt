Answer #1
setImmediate callbacks are called after I/O Queue callbacks are finished 
or timed out. setImmediate callbacks are placed in Check Queue, which are processed after I/O Queue.

setTimeout(fn, 0) callbacks are placed in Timer Queue and will be called after I/O 
callbacks as well as Check Queue callbacks. As event loop, process the timer queue first in each iteration, 
so which one will be executed first depends on which phase event loop is.

Answer #2

Use setImmediate if you want to queue the function behind whatever I/O event callbacks 
that are already in the event queue. Use process.nextTick to effectively queue the function at the head of 
the event queue so that it executes immediately after the current function completes.

So in a case where you're trying to break up a long running, CPU-bound job using recursion, 
you would now want to use setImmediate rather than process.nextTick to queue the next iteration 
as otherwise any I/O event callbacks wouldn't get the chance to run between iterations.
